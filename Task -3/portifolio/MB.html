        <h2>Mainstream film (2004–2010)</h2>
        <p>2004, Manjula produced his next film,[citation needed] Naani, directed by S. J. Surya co-starring Amisha Patel. While its simultaneously shot Tamil version New featuring a different cast proved to be commercially successful, Naani flopped at the box office.[20][non-primary source needed] He received his third Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in his next film, Arjun, directed by Gunasekhar and produced by Ramesh.[27] The film released on 18 August 2004[28] and was successful at the box-office.[29] The film was screened at the International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section. This was Keerthi Reddy's final acting performance prior to her retirement from the film industry.[30] He chose to act in Trivikram Srinivas's Athadu (2005), co-starring Trisha Krishnan, whose script had been approved back in 2002 before the production of Naani and Arjun had begun.[31][non-primary source needed] It emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.[32][33] The film proved to be a major boost for Babu's career as he received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu, in addition to fetching his second Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the role of a hired assassin.[34] The movie collected a share of ₹22 crores at the box office.[citation needed] Idlebrain.com gave it a rating of 3.25/5 and mentioned Mahesh Babu is stylish and brilliant as professional killer.[35]Cinegoer.net gave a review stating, "True the film gives an image of a Hollywood base for the drama. Even the taking, screenplay structure and execution of scenes, less talk and more action.[36]
        
        He then collaborated with Puri Jagannadh in 2006 for the film Pokiri, which was jointly produced by Jagannadh and Manjula.[37] He received high praise for his performance, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu opining that "Mahesh's understated performance in Pokiri allows him effortlessly to reclaim the title of a star, overshadowing his questionable career choices of late".[37] He won his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[38] That same year, his next film, Sainikudu, was released.[39] A critic from Rediff.com wrote that "Nonetheless, Sainikudu can be watched at least for its premise of letting the warrior in each individual surface, and the fact that it is done with the idea of motivating people to do something for their fellow humans".[40]
        
        The following year saw Babu acting in the film Athidhi, co-starring Amrita Rao, marking her Telugu debut. The film was produced by Mahesh Babu's's brother Ramesh.[41] UTV Motion Pictures acquired the film's distribution rights for ₹18.5 crore, which became its first Telugu film venture.[42] Jeevi of Idlebrain.com praised the film's first half while criticising the last thirty minutes of the film.[43] A critic from Rediff.com wrote that the film "is built up through a 'racy' screenplay which is gripping to an extent, but stretches to three long hours".[44] In 2008, Babu provided voice-over for the film Jalsa directed by Trivikram Srinivas.[45]
        
        After Athidhi's release, Babu took a break from films for seven months; two months later, he signed Khaleja, but the break was unintentionally extended for two years due to several delays. During this time, Babu's grandmother and his wife Namrata's parents died. Krishna was worried about Babu's career as the film's shoot was delayed for so long.[46] The film deals with illegal-mining in India, and related environmental damage.[47] It marks Babu's return as an actor after a three-year hiatus in his second collaboration with Trivikram after Athadu.
        
        Upon release, <b>Khaleja received mixed reviews from critics and was a commercial failure in India.</b>[48] However, it managed to perform well at the overseas box office becoming the highest grossing Telugu film at that time.[49] Rediff gave a 3 out of 5 rating and noted "The duo of Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is watchable, entertaining with good humour, couple of well-orchestrated action sequences and songs and with a bit to take home as well. It's Mahesh's show all the way, much to the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the soul of the movie, be it his dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or emotions, he is effortless.[50] The film is included in the list of "25 Greatest Telugu Films Of The Decade" by Film Companion.[51]</p>

The Income Tax Department officials conducted a raid on Babu's Jubilee Hills residence as he was rumoured of receiving a remuneration of more than ₹12 crore for his next projects.[56]
        
        He later played the role of a mafia kingpin with a hidden personal agenda in the film Businessman (2012), co-starring Kajal Aggarwal.[57] Upon the film's release, he received praise from critics for his performance in the film, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu writing, "The film has no frills, no vulgar wastage and the hero is practically in every frame; you hear only his voice, he looks good, sounds good, he also steals the comedian's job. Mahesh plays it straight".[58] He received his seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and his second nomination for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu) for his performance in the film.[59][60] By then, Babu was reported to be the second highest-paid actor in South India after Rajinikanth.[61]
        
        Babu then began filming for <mark style="background-color: cadetblue;"> Srikanth Addala's Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013)</mark>, whose script Babu had approved during the pre-production phase of Dookudu.[62] Co-starring Daggubati Venkatesh along with Anjali and Samantha Ruth Prabhu, it became the first Telugu multistarrer film to be produced in the last twenty-five years.[63] Released in January 2013, the film became one of the highest grossing Telugu films of the year and marked the completion of Babu's hat-trick of successful films.[64] Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called the film a "delightful family drama with its celebration of family bonds, love and marriage laced with laughter", and Addala "wants to leave his audience with a thought, wants them to reflect on their relationships and overlook skirmishes that can sour family bonds". Dundoo cited Guhan's cinematography as one of the film's highlights, and praised its performances.[65] He won his fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and his second SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu) for his performance in the film.[66][67] He provided a voice-over for Srinu Vaitla's Baadshah the same year.[68]
        
        Babu had two releases in 2014, the first one being Sukumar's 1: Nenokkadine, an action thriller focusing on a celebrity suffering from hallucinations related to the murder of his parents and the discovery of a special variety of rice.[69] Babu's performance received praise, with critics calling it one of his best performances.[70][71][72] For his performance, he received his fourth nomination for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu).[73]</p>
        
        <h2>Resurgence and recent work (2015–present)</h2>
        <p>Babu collaborated with <b>Koratala Siva for the action drama film Srimanthudu (2015) co-starring Shruti Haasan.</b> He co-produced the film under his newly formed banner G. Mahesh Babu Entertainment Pvt. Ltd, marking his first film production venture.[74] He opted to do so to control the film's budget, accepting a share in profits in lieu of remuneration.[75] Released on 7 August 2015, Srimanthudu opened to positive reviews from critics,[76] and he won his fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for the film.[77][78] Sethumadhavan N. of Bangalore Mirror stated, Srimanthudu wouldn't have been as effective if it did not have Mahesh Babu who is at his charming best, adding that he "underplays the emotional scenes, making them a treat to watch".[79] Babu also adopted his native village, Burripalem.[80] Babu won third SIIMA award for best actor for his performance in the film.[81]
        
        In 2016, he acted in the film Brahmotsavam co-starring Kajal Aggarwal, Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Pranitha Subhash. Originally produced as a bi-lingual, the film would've marked Babu's first straight-out Tamil film.[82] While the film underperformed at the box office, the Deccan Chronicle stated that Mahesh Babu was its saving grace.[83]</p>
