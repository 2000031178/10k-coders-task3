    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Samantha was born on 28 April 1987, her father Joseph Prabhu is Telugu and mother Ninette Prabhu is Malayali.[6] She was born and brought up in the Pallavaram neighborhood of Chennai, Tamil Nadu,[7] as the youngest child of the family, with two elder brothers Jonath and David. She can speak both Tamil and Telugu fluently. [8][9] As a part of her education, Samantha was schooled at Holy Angels Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School and then completed a degree in commerce at Stella Maris College, Chennai.[8][10] Towards the end of her undergraduate degree, she became involved in modelling, notably working with Naidu Hall, through which she was first spotted by filmmaker Ravi Varman.[11]</p>

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <h3>Debut, breakthrough and critical acclaim (2010–2012)</h3>
    <p>Samantha began her professional film career with Gautham Vasudev Menon's Telugu film, Ye Maaya Chesave (2010). The film, simultaneously made in Tamil as Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010), was highly anticipated prior to release, primarily due to the first time collaboration between Gautham Menon and composer A. R. Rahman.[12] The actress successfully auditioned and was signed up for the project in August 2009. The film was shot in India and the United States, and it was released on 26 February 2010.[13] Post-release, she revealed that Menon played a "crucial part in moulding her as an actress", teaching her how to remain natural and comfortable in front of the screen, even if she had no dialogues in a scene.[14] In the film, Samantha played the lead character Jessie, a Malayali Saint Thomas Christian girl living in Hyderabad, with whom the male protagonist, played by Naga Chaitanya, falls in love. Upon
     release of the film, Samantha received highly positive reviews for her portrayal, with the film itself garnering widespread critical acclaim.[15] Critics at Sify praised Samantha as a "scene-stealer" and her beauty as "alluring", adding, "she was the girl to watch out for."[15] Jeevi from Idlebrain.com, wrote that 
    "Samantha's debut is one of the best heroine debuts in Telugu cinema" and noted that the "minute expressions she gave spoke volumes about her", whilst labelling the film as a "classic". Her performance in Ye Maaya Chesave earned her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut – South and the Nandi Special Jury Award.[16][17][18] Samantha appeared in a cameo role in the Tamil version of the film, portraying an assistant director who becomes an actress.[19] Both the Telugu and the Tamil versions of the films proved to be major successes, propelling Samantha to stardom.[20] She followed up her collaborations with Gautham Menon and A. R. Rahman by appearing in the music video for the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010 promotional song, Semmozhiyaana Thamizh Mozhiyaam, which Menon directed and Rahman composed.[citation needed]</p>

    <h3>Commercial success and establishment in big-budget films (2013–2018)</h3>
    <p>Although Samantha often portrayed strong character roles in her early films, post-2012, she has appeared increasingly in big-budget, hero-oriented films, which have comparatively smaller scope for actresses.[53] Samantha next appeared in the Telugu multi-starrer film, Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013) alongside Venkatesh and Mahesh Babu, which received positive reviews and was commercially successful. Though her role was comparatively minuscule to her co-stars, IBN Live noted it was "good to see Samantha shed her glamorous side and welcome performance-oriented roles, which she only handles with deftness and ease".[54][55] The romantic comedy Jabardasth (2013) alongside Siddharth, in which she portrayed a wedding planner, became a commercial failure, though critics noted Samantha is "getting better by the day and it's a delight to watch her on screen".[56][57] Samantha then starred alongside Pawan Kalyan in the family drama, Attarintiki Daredi (2013), which emerged as the highest-grossing Telugu film upon release. A critic from Rediff.com noted Samantha "exudes confidence even though she has limited screen time and nothing much to do", and her performance saw her win Best Actress recognition at the SIIMA Awards and the Santosham Film Awards, in addition to her fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu.[58] Her final release of 2013 was in the unsuccessful Telugu masala film Ramayya Vasthavayya, where she had a small role, with a critic noting "we have seen Samantha in better roles and better films."[59]</p>

    <h2>Personal life and off-screen work</h2>
    <p>Samantha suffered from an extended period of illness in 2012, which saw her having to opt out of big film projects and take a two-month break from acting. She suffered from an immunity disorder and then had a further setback after her body did not respond well to antibiotics.[119] She began dating actor Naga Chaitanya in 2010 after appearing in the film Ye Maaya Chesave. The pair were engaged in a ceremony in Hyderabad on 29 January 2017.[120][121] She got married in Goa as per traditional Hindu customs on 6 October 2017 and then by Christian customs on 7 October 2017,[122] and became a member of the Akkineni family.[123] She then started using her married name, Samantha Akkineni.[124][125] On 31 July 2021, she removed her surname "Akkineni" from her social media handles which led to speculations of her separation with Naga Chaitanya.[126][127][128] Later, on 2 October 2021, they announced their separation and eventual divorce.[129][130]

        On 28 September 2020, Samantha became the founder of the women's clothing brand Saaki World.[131]
        
        After June 2022, Samantha was suddenly inactive on social media which sparked several rumours about her health and there were rumours of her suffering from a relapse of a rare skin disorder. However, her team dismissed all rumours.[132] On 29 October 2022, she announced that she was diagnosed with dermatomyositis.[133][134] In August 2023, Samantha served as Chief Guest at the world's largest Indian Independence Day Parade in Manhattan, New York City.[135][136]</p>
